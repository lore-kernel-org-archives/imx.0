I agree, but another way to phrase it is: bridges aren't aware of how
the chain is setup, the encoder ties it all together.

Yes, and bridges should ideally remain as lightly affected as possible.
We have probably around 100 bridge drivers at the moment, having some
kind of opt-in to enable hotplug would mean that we can't expect hotplug
to work on a new platform, which should be a last resort.

Yes. To make things a bit more precise, we need two things: the encoder
to put the chain together, and "something" (that you used to call
manager) to react to hotplug events and handle the bridge
detach/destruction, connector creation/destruction, etc and should stick
around when we enable hotplug.

What I'm suggesting is that, since the encoder already owns and creates
the chain in the first place, and is there forever, it's only natural
for the encoder to be that "something", and we don't necessarily mean
creating a new entity or piece of code. A bunch of helpers and hooks a
probably going to be enough.

This is where the opt-in part should be, and I'd like, if possible, for
hotplug-enabled encoders to work with any bridge.

=46rom a high level point-of-view, I think we mostly agree. We can argue
on the name, and if we should merge it with something else
(drm_encoder_init, drm_bridge_attach, something else?) but that's the
path forward I think.
