Hi Peng,

I apologise in advance for exploiting this thread to make my point.

I had complained once in the past. I am repeating that again. You are not
new to the kernel development, yet at times I get really surprised with
the way you manage your patches and create so much confusion. It gets
extremely difficult to track what is happening if one doesn't follow all
your patches for a week(week is too lenient IMO, you manage sometime to
create same amount of confusion in just 2 days).

And as usually you ignore merge window and post a whole set of new series
on the first day of merge window. Which is fine especially if you are new
to kernel development(not true in your case though) or even otherwise if
you don't regularly track upstream cycle so much because of corporate
commitments(which may be true in your case and I am fine with that). But
you need to wait at-least a few days after the merge window so you give
every one a chance to follow your work.

And in this case, I would have avoided scmi changes are you have non-scmi
specific driver to get the core clock changes review first and then added
SCMI as it is OEM specific and we need to analyse it without other things
in flux or under discussion.
