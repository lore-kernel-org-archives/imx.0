It is not a hotplug-bridge in a trench coat, no :) The code is clear about
this.

I'd say with this series a "drm_bridge_connector" is just becoming
something more (perhaps something else too). Somewhat as "a drm_bridge is
either a bridge or something else". :)


But let's leave names aside for a moment. If just looking at the current
code, the drm_bridge_connector is "a handler, owned by the card/encoder and
having the same lifetime, which takes care of drm_connector
creation/destruction at card probe/removal".

What we need now is just the same plug " and on hotplug events" appended.

So in both cases there needs to be "a handler persitent with the card".

Do we agree so far?


Now, the reason I chose to extend the drm_bridge_connector to achieve the
above is what I tried to motivate in the cover letter:

Before taking that approach I considered some options:

 1. Create a new component, which is a "a handler, owned by the
    card/encoder and having the same lifetime, which takes care of
    drm_connector creation/destruction at card probe/removal and on hotplug
    events", and wait for drivers to migrate from the drm_bridge_connector
    to this new thing

 2. Create a new component, which is a "handler, owned by the card/encoder
    and having the same lifetime, which reacts to hotplug events by
    creating/destroying a drm_bridge_connector (slightly modified to be
    non-drmm), which in turn takes care of drm_connector
    creation/destruction", and wait for drivers to migrate to this new
    thing

 3. Extend the dm_bridge_connector to:
    - behave as before if using the current API
    - behave as before + hotplug if using a new API
    (the migration in most cases is as simple as patch 37)

All 3 options require changes in card drivers to use a new API (and a new
object type for cases 1 and 2).

To me options 1 and 2 involve more redundant code and/or more complexity.

Your thoughts?
