It's a complex problem, so I don't think we should expect the target
audience to be newcomers. But maybe we can indeed improve it.

No. It's not legacy or deprecated. And about the conversion, I guess
it's on a case-by-case basis? It's not encouraged or discouraged anyway.

Nowhere is it said that we're considering a MIPI-DSI link here, so the
use case is any bridge that isn't using MIPI-DSI at all.

You tell me :)

How does hotplugging, say, a MIPI-DSI device bridge controlled over I2C,
or a MIPI-DSI host bridge, affect the probing sequence, and can we end
up in endless probe deferrals?

Not necessarily, and from a KMS point of view, MIPI-DSI doesn't exist,
only bridge do.

It doesn't have to be.
