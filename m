I see, OK, thanks for the clarification!

I had missed this is called from drm_bridge_chain_mode_valid(), which
already takes the bridge_chain_mutex thanks to
drm_for_each_bridge_in_chain_from().

So that means this loop is safe, but it would be nice to add a comment to
make it clear to future readers. E.g. "/* we are called by
drm_bridge_chain_mode_valid(), so the bridge_chain_mutex is locked */".

Still I'm not a fan of having a loop over the bridge chain (this function)
inside another loop over the same bridge chain (in
drm_bridge_chain_mode_valid(). And even more I'm not a fan of drivers
walking around the bridge chain on their own, IMO the core (perhaps
drm_bridge.c in this case) should to the loops . However this is a general
concern, it happens also elsewhere, and I have no immediate proposal to
improve this, so don't consider it as a blocker for this patch.

As I said I'm quite ignorance about this aspect, so I asked to better
understand. In reply to another part fo the thread: no, I don't have a
specific concern if this is the common practice.
