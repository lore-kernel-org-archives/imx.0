drm_connector_manager?
drm_bridge_connector_manager?

What? o_O

Several encoder drivers have been painfully converted to create a
drm_bridge_connector. Now if the bridges start doing it themselves we
should go back to those encoder drivers and ditch all the
drm_bridge_connector from there?

I must be missing something. Can you elaborate on this?
